# Bruin Brick Breaker

### Team: Issa, Yaolan, Hussein

### About the project: We set out to recreate the Atari classic game known as breakout.

The objective of the game is simple! Use the paddle to bounce the ball and destroy all the bricks in the level.

If the ball falls below where the paddle is, you lose a life. When you lose three lives the game is over. 
Breaking bricks increases your score. The bricks have varying health levels represented by their color and as you hit
them, they lose a life until finally they break.

### Advanced Features implemented:

We simulated physisc to handle the bouncing effect for the ball. We also implemented Collision Detection to detect when
the ball hits the bricks and when it hits the paddle.
